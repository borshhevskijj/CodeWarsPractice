Pig latin is created by taking all the consonants before the first vowel of a word and moving them to the back of the word followed by the letters "ay".

"hello" => "ellohay"
"creating" => "eatingcray"
If the first letter of the word is a vowel, the string is left the same and the letters "way" are appended to the end.

"algorithm" => "algorithmway"
This problem is different from other variations in that it expects casing to remain the same so:

"Hello World" => "Ellohay Orldway"
as well as punctuation.

"Pizza? Yes please!" => "Izzapay? Esyay easeplay!"
Your job is to take a string and translate it to Pig Latin. The string will never be undefined but may contain both numbers and letters. A word will never be a combination of numbers and letters. Also, there will never be punctuation at the beginning of a word and the only capital letter in a word will be the first letter meaning there are zero all capitalized words.
